# CS305

The client was Artemis Financial.  The company wanted to modernize it's approach to software development by implementing security standards.

When finding my client's vulnerabilities, I found most of it was just oudated dependencies. It is important to code securely for the rest of protecting assets.

The most difficult part for me with the vulnerabilities assessment was how long it took to find vulnerabilities. I wonder if there is a way to speed up the automated checking and downloading of CVE.

To increase layers of security I used the SHA-256 encryption cipher. It is but one of many layers of security you can use to increase overall security of the product. I think that both manual code reviews and automated checking of vulnerabilities can be beneficial in finding security flaws in a product.

I made sure the code was functional and secure by running an automated OWASP security check and also with a manual code review. The most beneficial thing I have learned in this course is the important of secure programming. It is not only a necessity, but it is a multistep process to include layers of security. 

If I wanted to show one thing to future employers, it is my overall code process and the SHA-256 encryption cipher addition.
